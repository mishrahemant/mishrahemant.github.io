  <h3>Phone: 612-226-4672, Email: hemantkmishra@gmail.com</h3>
  <p>An accomplished senior scientist with 18+ years of extensive research experience in the area of Immunology, 
    Molecular Biology, and Experimental Therapeutics. I have cutting edge expertise and training in the application of 
    regulated proteolysis of cell surface proteins and its applications in tumor immunology, dysregulated immune response 
    during severe infection and host-pathogen interactions. Along with the proficiency of numerous mice manipulation 
    techniques, I also have a firm grasp on several tumor xenograft mice models to study the in-vivo tumor killing by 
    engineered human iPSC derived NK and T cells. Moreover, I possess the skill set of murine  aseptic surgeries, including 
    induction of polymicrobial sepsis through cecal-ligation and puncture and survival surgeries. I am a Co-director of
    translational core facility at Vet and Biomedical Science at the University of Minnesota with years of teaching, training
    and mentoring experience of students, faculty and staff on basic and advanced immunology involving hands-on training on 
    flow cytometry. I am also a grant writing expert and senior editor and have wide-ranging experience in providing 
    scientific guidance in compiling, editing and submitting various winning grant proposals. I have been  in  several  
    leadership  roles  throughout my academic career. Together with excellent communication skills I am a visionary who 
    inspire individual and organizational growth, a facilitator who works with others to attain results, a contributor who 
    applies personal capabilities to execute and accomplish tasks in an efficient and timely manner and a tactician who 
    ensure  to effectuate the desired goals in line with the mission of the department. <a
